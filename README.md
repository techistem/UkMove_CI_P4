## Wireframes

### Wireframe Planning Process

For UkMove, the wireframe section focuses on planning the structure and layout of the website to ensure an optimal user
experience. The wireframes were designed to create a user-friendly, responsive platform where users can easily navigate
and find the information they need.

1. **_Wireframes Created Using Balsamiq_**
   The wireframe planning process began with digital wireframes created using the desktop version of
   [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Link to Balsamiq homepage"). This tool allowed for clear visualization of the websiteâ€™s
   layout and functionality, focusing on key pages such as the homepage, blog posts, user registration, and areas for user interaction.

2. **_Focus on User Experience_**
   The wireframes were designed with a strong focus on providing a positive user experience. This involved planning intuitive
   navigation, ensuring users can easily access blog posts, create accounts, comment, and navigate between different sections
   of the site. A seamless user journey was prioritized, making it simple for users to find information about living in the UK
   and interact with the community.

3. **_Future Development_**
   Due to time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, certain pages, like the Destinations page, were postponed for
   future development.

They can be found below:

## Flow Chart

A flowchart for UKMove was created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ERD-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)
to visually represent the user interactions and website processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.
This chart acts as a roadmap for the logical flow of actions on the site, helping to maintain consistency in its functionality.

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this website:

![Flow Chart](documentation/features/flowcharts.png)

## Color Scheme

For UKMove, I selected colors inspired by the UK flag, focusing on creating a balanced and inviting visual theme. The color
palette incorporates dark blue, red, and white, providing a strong and recognizable connection to the UK while maintaining
a modern and professional appearance.

The darker tones of blue and red were chosen to give the site a sophisticated and calm atmosphere, aligning with the sense of
stability and trust needed for users navigating big life changes like moving to a new country. White is used strategically for
text and accents to ensure clarity and readability against the darker backgrounds.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to experiment and refine the palette, ensuring the colors complement each other and provide sufficient contrast
for accessibility. The chosen colors not only reflect the identity of the UK but also create an aesthetically pleasing and
user-friendly experience.

Details of the full colour palette can be found below:

![Color Scheme](documentation/features/colour_scheme.png)

## Fonts

The fonts selected were from Google Fonts, Montserrat wits sans-serif as a backup font.

## Structure

### Wesites Pages

The UKMove website was designed with a user-friendly layout to ensure easy navigation. A consistent navigation bar
is located at the top of each page, providing quick access to key sections of the site. For smaller screens,
a hamburger menu is included to maintain functionality and accessibility on mobile devices.

The footer contains all relevant links to UKMoveâ€™s social media platforms, allowing users to connect and engage further.
By following UKMove on social media, users can stay updated on the latest content, tips, and community discussions,
helping to expand the platform's reach and foster a supportive network.

The site consists of the following pages:

- The Home Page(the blog) of UKMove serves as the first point of contact for users and is designed to be welcoming, informative, and easy to navigate. Key elements of the page include: Hero Section, Navigation Bar, Introduction Text,
  Call-to-Action Buttons, Featured Blog Posts or Updates, User Testimonials or Tips, Footer

- The About Page of UKMove provides an overview of the website's purpose and mission. It introduces the platform as a supportive space for individuals transitioning to life in the UK, offering practical tips, shared experiences, and a community to connect with.The page aims to build trust and create a welcoming impression for users exploring the site.Key elements include:

## Tools & Technologies Used

### Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) are essential for visualizing the structure of a database before implementing models. They help to define the relationships between various tables, ensuring that the database is efficient and meets the needs of the project. By planning these relationships early, potential issues can be avoided, saving time during the development process.

For the UKMove project, a database schema was designed and mapped out before any coding began. Following best practices, the schema clearly outlines the relationships between the database tables to support the intended functionality of the platform.

To create the ERD, a free version of [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) was utilized, providing a comprehensive and visually clear representation of the database structure.

Below is the database schema designed for the UKMove platform.

- Updated project ERD:

  ![Database Schema](documentation/features/ukmove_flowchart.png)

- Initial project ERD:

  ![Database Schema](documentation/features/database_schema.png)

## Agile Development Process

The UKMove project was managed using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/techistem/UkMove_CI_P4/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
to ensure an organized and efficient workflow aligned with Agile principles.

- The project's tasks were organized as individual User Stories, each containing acceptance criteria and specific goals.

- Each User Story was assigned a label based on the MoSCoW System (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize tasks effectively.

- A clear task board was maintained, allowing for tracking progress and managing workload efficiently.

- Story points were assigned to estimate the time and effort required for completing each User Story, ensuring realistic planning and timelines.

This approach helped maintain focus and allowed for a structured development process throughout the project.

![Agile Approach - Kanban Board](documentation/features/agile_approach.png)

### GitHubProjects

UkMove project was managed from the beginning using [GitHub Projects (View Project Here)](https://github.com/users/techistem/projects/18), in order to ensure an agile approach. Please refer above to [Agile Development Process](#agile-development-process) for more details.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/techistem/UkMove_CI_P4/issues) as an another Agile tool. There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

GitHub Issues were used to create User Stories for the project. Each issue was added to the UKMove Project and assigned relevant labels. Please refer above to [Agile Development Process](#agile-development-process) for more details.

![Github Issues](documentation/github_issues.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritisation

The development process was structured by breaking tasks into detailed user stories, enabling a clear and manageable workflow.
This approach allowed for the application of MoSCoW prioritization and appropriate labels to user stories within the Issues tab,
ensuring efficient task management and focus on project objectives.

- **Must Have**: Essential features that are guaranteed to be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value but are not critical for immediate delivery.
- **Could Have**: Features with lower impact that can be omitted without affecting core functionality.
- **Won't Have**: Features that are not prioritized for this iteration and are planned for future development.

# Deployment

### Version Control

The website was created using Visual Studio Code editor. The webpage was deployed on Heroku and can be visisted [HERE](https://ukmove-45adf8d4e460.herokuapp.com/).

Git was used to push changes in the local enviroment to the remote repository using the following commands:

`git add .` - This command is used to add any changed files to the staging area before they are commited.

`git commit -m "message"` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready to be pushed.

- Commits were made after every small and incremental change to enhance maintainability with a clear commit history.
- Commit messages were made in alignment with the EU Commissions [Commit guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/v1.15.0/eu/docs/conventions/git/) for clear and readable message.

`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on Github.

### Initial Deployment

#### Getting Set Up

These are the steps for inital deployment after you have created your Github repository and set up your chosen IDE.

1. Install Django `pip3 install Django`
2. Add a requirements.txt file `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
3. Create a Django project `django-admin startproject project_name .`
4. Create an app `python manage.py startapp app_name`
5. Next, you need to add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in your setting.py file in your newly created project
6. Create an env.py file with the following variables:
   - os.environ.setdefault(
     "DATABASE_URL", "your_database_url")
   - os.environ.setdefault(
     "CLOUDINARY_URL", "your_cloudinary_url")
   - os.environ.setdefault(
     "SECRET_KEY", "your_secret_key"
     )
7. Go back to your settiings.py file, import your env.py file and add the following:
   - `SECRET_KEY = {'default': os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")}`
   - `DEBUG = True`
   - `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`
8. Install the packages required to connect to your database of choice, as this project uses PostgreSQL you need to install the following:
   - `pip3 install dj-database-url psycopg2`
9. Add them to your requirements file `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
10. In your projects settings.py file import the following:

```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```

11. Create database tables with the following command `python manage.py migrate`
12. Create a superuser `python manage.py createsuperuser`
13. Set ALLOWED_HOST for your local server
14. Create a .gitingore file and add your env.py as well as other sensetive files that should not be deployed
15. Run the following git commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "inital commit"
git push
```

### Heroku (Production) Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are al follows:

1. Run the following command `pip3 install gunicorn`. This will allow for Heroku deployment
2. Add this to your requirements.txt file: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
3. In the root directory of your project add a file with the name `Procfile` with no file extension
4. In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project.
   - `web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi`
   - Note: Always set DEBUG to FALSE before deploying a project to a production enviroment
5. In your settings.py files ALLOWED_HOSTS list, append the Heroku host name to the list `,'.herokuapp.com'`
6. In your Heroku dashboard, create a new app
7. Once in your app dashboard, click on the `Settings` tab. It is important to get the settings set up before attemping to deploy the app
8. Since your env.py file will not be pushed to Github, Heroku cannot read it. This means we need to set them up in Heroku manually:
   - Navigate to the `Config Vars` section and click `Reveal config vars`
   - Add the following Keys and their values:
     - `CLOUDINARY_URL`
     - `DATABASE_URL`
     - `SECRET_KEY`
9. Navigate to the `Deploy` tab and select `GitHub`
10. Click `Connect to Github` and log in to your GitHub account
11. Search for your GitHub repository in the `Connect to GitHub section`
12. Once found click `connect` then click `Deploy`
13. Once deployment is complete, click `View` to see your deployed project

### Run Locally

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

- Click on the code drop down button
- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal
  The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.

### Fork Project

To fork the repository, follow the steps bellow:

- Go to the GitHub repository
- Click on `Fork`
- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository
