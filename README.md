recently moved or are planning to relocate, the platform provides valuable information about living in the UK.

Visitors to the website can explore various topics, gaining insights and practical advice on settling into a new

### Wireframes

### Wireframe Planning Process

For UkMove, the wireframe section focuses on planning the structure and layout of the website to ensure an optimal user
experience. The wireframes were designed to create a user-friendly, responsive platform where users can easily navigate 
and find the information they need.

1. ***Wireframes Created Using Balsamiq***
The wireframe planning process began with digital wireframes created using the desktop version of 
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Link to Balsamiq homepage"). This tool allowed for clear visualization of the website’s 
layout and functionality, focusing on key pages such as the homepage, blog posts, user registration, and areas for user interaction.

2. ***Focus on User Experience***
The wireframes were designed with a strong focus on providing a positive user experience. This involved planning intuitive
navigation, ensuring users can easily access blog posts, create accounts, comment, and navigate between different sections 
of the site. A seamless user journey was prioritized, making it simple for users to find information about living in the UK 
and interact with the community.

3. ***Future Development***
Due to time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, certain pages, like the Destinations page, were postponed for 
future development.

### Flow Chart

A flowchart for UKMove was created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) 
to visually represent the user interactions and website processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. 
This chart acts as a roadmap for the logical flow of actions on the site, helping to maintain consistency in its functionality.

 Below is the flowchart of the main process of this website:

 ### Color Scheme

 For UKMove, I selected colors inspired by the UK flag, focusing on creating a balanced and inviting visual theme. The color 
 palette incorporates dark blue, red, and white, providing a strong and recognizable connection to the UK while maintaining 
 a modern and professional appearance.

The darker tones of blue and red were chosen to give the site a sophisticated and calm atmosphere, aligning with the sense of 
stability and trust needed for users navigating big life changes like moving to a new country. White is used strategically for
 text and accents to ensure clarity and readability against the darker backgrounds.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to experiment and refine the palette, ensuring the colors complement each other and provide sufficient contrast 
for accessibility. The chosen colors not only reflect the identity of the UK but also create an aesthetically pleasing and 
user-friendly experience.

Details of the full colour palette can be found below:

## Fonts

The fonts selected were from Google Fonts, Montserrat wits sans-serif as a backup font.

## Structure

### Wesites Pages

The UKMove website was designed with a user-friendly layout to ensure easy navigation. A consistent navigation bar
is located at the top of each page, providing quick access to key sections of the site. For smaller screens, 
a hamburger menu is included to maintain functionality and accessibility on mobile devices.

The footer contains all relevant links to UKMove’s social media platforms, allowing users to connect and engage further.

## Tools & Technologies Used

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) are essential for visualizing the structure of a database before implementing models. They help to define the relationships between various tables, ensuring that the database is efficient and meets the needs of the project. By planning these relationships early, potential issues can be avoided, saving time during the development process.

For the UKMove project, a database schema was designed and mapped out before any coding began. Following best practices, the schema clearly outlines the relationships between the database tables to support the intended functionality of the platform.

To create the ERD, a free version of [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) was utilized, providing a comprehensive and visually clear representation of the database structure.

Below is the database schema designed for the UKMove platform.
