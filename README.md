user stories with their acceptance criteria and tasks can be viewed on the 
[Github Project Board](https://github.com/users/techistem/projects/18).

## Wireframes

### Wireframe Planning Process

For UkMove, the wireframe section focuses on planning the structure and layout of the website to ensure an optimal user
experience. The wireframes were designed to create a user-friendly, responsive platform where users can easily navigate 
and find the information they need.

1. ***Wireframes Created Using Balsamiq***
The wireframe planning process began with digital wireframes created using the desktop version of 
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Link to Balsamiq homepage"). This tool allowed for clear visualization of the websiteâ€™s 
layout and functionality, focusing on key pages such as the homepage, blog posts, user registration, and areas for user interaction.

2. ***Focus on User Experience***
The wireframes were designed with a strong focus on providing a positive user experience. This involved planning intuitive
navigation, ensuring users can easily access blog posts, create accounts, comment, and navigate between different sections 
of the site. A seamless user journey was prioritized, making it simple for users to find information about living in the UK 
and interact with the community.

3. ***Future Development***
Due to time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, certain pages, like the Destinations page, were postponed for 
future development. 

They can be found below:

## Flow Chart

A flowchart for UKMove was created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) 
to visually represent the user interactions and website processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. 
This chart acts as a roadmap for the logical flow of actions on the site, helping to maintain consistency in its functionality.

 Below is the flowchart of the main process of this website:

 ![Flow Chart](documentation/features/flowcharts.png) 

 ## Color Scheme

 For UKMove, I selected colors inspired by the UK flag, focusing on creating a balanced and inviting visual theme. The color 
 palette incorporates dark blue, red, and white, providing a strong and recognizable connection to the UK while maintaining 
 a modern and professional appearance.

The darker tones of blue and red were chosen to give the site a sophisticated and calm atmosphere, aligning with the sense of 
stability and trust needed for users navigating big life changes like moving to a new country. White is used strategically for
 text and accents to ensure clarity and readability against the darker backgrounds.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to experiment and refine the palette, ensuring the colors complement each other and provide sufficient contrast 
for accessibility. The chosen colors not only reflect the identity of the UK but also create an aesthetically pleasing and 
user-friendly experience.

Details of the full colour palette can be found below:

## Fonts

The fonts selected were from Google Fonts, Montserrat wits sans-serif as a backup font.

## Structure

### Wesites Pages

The UKMove website was designed with a user-friendly layout to ensure easy navigation. A consistent navigation bar
is located at the top of each page, providing quick access to key sections of the site. For smaller screens, 
a hamburger menu is included to maintain functionality and accessibility on mobile devices.

The footer contains all relevant links to UKMoveâ€™s social media platforms, allowing users to connect and engage further.
By following UKMove on social media, users can stay updated on the latest content, tips, and community discussions, 
helping to expand the platform's reach and foster a supportive network.

The site consists of the following pages:
   * The Home Page(the blog) of UKMove serves as the first point of contact for users and is designed to be welcoming, informative, and easy to navigate. Key elements of the page include: Hero Section, Navigation Bar, Introduction Text,
   Call-to-Action Buttons, Featured Blog Posts or Updates, User Testimonials or Tips, Footer

   * The About Page of UKMove provides an overview of the website's purpose and mission. It introduces the platform as a supportive space for individuals transitioning to life in the UK, offering practical tips, shared experiences, and a community to connect with.The page aims to build trust and create a welcoming impression for users exploring the site.Key elements include:

## Tools & Technologies Used

### Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) are essential for visualizing the structure of a database before implementing models. They help to define the relationships between various tables, ensuring that the database is efficient and meets the needs of the project. By planning these relationships early, potential issues can be avoided, saving time during the development process.

For the UKMove project, a database schema was designed and mapped out before any coding began. Following best practices, the schema clearly outlines the relationships between the database tables to support the intended functionality of the platform.

To create the ERD, a free version of [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) was utilized, providing a comprehensive and visually clear representation of the database structure.

Below is the database schema designed for the UKMove platform.

* Updated project ERD:

* Initial project ERD:

## Agile Development Process

The UKMove project was managed using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/techistem/UkMove_CI_P4/projects?query=is%3Aopen) 
to ensure an organized and efficient workflow aligned with Agile principles.

* The project's tasks were organized as individual User Stories, each containing acceptance criteria and specific goals.

* Each User Story was assigned a label based on the MoSCoW System (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize tasks effectively.

* A clear task board was maintained, allowing for tracking progress and managing workload efficiently.

* Story points were assigned to estimate the time and effort required for completing each User Story, ensuring realistic planning and timelines.

This approach helped maintain focus and allowed for a structured development process throughout the project.

### GitHubProjects

UkMove project was managed from the beginning using [GitHub Projects (View Project Here)](https://github.com/users/techistem/projects/18), in order to ensure an agile approach. Please refer above to [Agile Development Process](#agile-development-process) for more details. 

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/techistem/UkMove_CI_P4/issuesserved) as an another Agile tool. There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

GitHub Issues were used to create User Stories for the project. Each issue was added to the UKMove Project and assigned relevant labels. Please refer above to [Agile Development Process](#agile-development-process) for more details.

![Github Issues](documentation/github_issues.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritisation

The development process was structured by breaking tasks into detailed user stories, enabling a clear and manageable workflow.
This approach allowed for the application of MoSCoW prioritization and appropriate labels to user stories within the Issues tab, 
ensuring efficient task management and focus on project objectives.

- **Must Have**: Essential features that are guaranteed to be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value but are not critical for immediate delivery.
- **Could Have**: Features with lower impact that can be omitted without affecting core functionality.
- **Won't Have**: Features that are not prioritized for this iteration and are planned for future development.
